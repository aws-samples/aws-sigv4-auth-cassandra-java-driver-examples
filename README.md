# AWS SigV4 Auth Plugin for Cassandra

 This repo contains example code for using the AWS SigV4 Auth Plugin for Cassandra. These are based on the documentation
 for the plugin at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mcs/latest/devguide/identity-and-access-mgmt.html#IAM.Samples.Roles.

 ## Building

 In order to build the example code, you will need Maven version 3.6.3 or higher, which you can obtain from
 https://maven.apache.org/. Once you have Maven installed, you can build a shaded (all dependencies included) JAR with
 the command:

 ``` shell
 mvn package
 ```

 Once this is complete, you should have an `target/aws-sigv4-auth-cassandra-java-driver-examples-1.0.3.jar` file.

 ## EC2

 The OrdersFetcher is a standalone class for retrieving orders from the acme.orders table, as part of the example in the
 documentation at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mcs/latest/devguide/identity-and-access-mgmt.html#IAM.Samples.Roles.

 You can copy the shaded JAR, along with the `cassandra_truststore.jks` file, to an EC2 instance that has an associated IAM role for MCS
 access. You can execute the JAR with the command:

 ``` shell
 java -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=./cassandra_truststore.jks \
   -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=amazon \
   -jar aws-sigv4-auth-cassandra-java-driver-examples-1.0.3.jar \
   <region> <endpoint> <customer ID>
 ```

 For example, to lookup orders for our pretend customer "1234" in us-east-2:

 ``` shell
 java -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=./cassandra_truststore.jks \
   -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=amazon \
   -jar aws-sigv4-auth-cassandra-java-driver-examples-1.0.3.jar \
   us-east-2 cassandra.us-east-2.amazonaws.com 1234
 ```
